# Complete Deployment Guide: Making Your Project Accessible

## Overview
Your Content Request Application is ready for deployment! The authentication is working with Microsoft credentials, and all code is committed. Follow these steps to deploy it and get a shareable link.

## Current Status âœ…
- âœ… Authentication configured with Microsoft Graph
- âœ… Code committed to local git repository
- âœ… Azure Static Web Apps deployment workflow configured
- âœ… Ready for GitHub deployment

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `content-request-app`
3. Description: `Content Request Application with Microsoft Authentication`
4. Make it **Public** (required for Azure Static Web Apps free tier)
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, GitHub will show commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
cd content-request-app
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/content-request-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Watch the "Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD" workflow
4. Once complete, it will show the deployment URL

### Step 4: Update Azure AD Configuration
1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" â†’ "App registrations"
3. Find your app: "Content Request App"
4. Go to "Authentication"
5. Add the new deployment URL to "Redirect URIs":
   - Format: `https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-URL.azurestaticapps.net`
6. Save the changes

### Step 5: Test and Share
1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Test Microsoft authentication
3. Share the URL with others!

## Authentication Details
- **App ID**: e3127686-042e-4dc4-9204-4dd4c78e666d
- **Tenant**: Microsoft (72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
- **Permissions**: Microsoft Graph (User.Read, openid, profile, email)

## For External Users
Users with Microsoft accounts can:
1. Visit your shared URL
2. Click "Sign in with Microsoft"
3. Grant consent for basic profile access
4. Use the application immediately

No additional setup required for users!

## Expected Deployment URL
Your app will be deployed to a URL like:
`https://KIND-PLANT-0XXXXXXX.azurestaticapps.net`

The exact URL will be shown in the GitHub Actions deployment log.

## Troubleshooting
If authentication fails after deployment:
1. Ensure the deployment URL is added to Azure AD redirect URIs
2. Check that the app is publicly accessible
3. Verify the authentication configuration in `src/authConfig.ts`

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. âœ… Get the deployment URL
2. âœ… Update Azure AD redirect URIs
3. âœ… Test authentication with the live URL
4. âœ… Share the URL with others
5. ðŸ”„ Monitor usage and gather feedback

Your application will be fully accessible to anyone with Microsoft credentials once deployed!

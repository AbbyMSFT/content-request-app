## ðŸ”„ Port Management Solution
To avoid future port conflicts, you now have multiple localhost ports configured in Azure AD. The application will automatically detect the current port and use it for authentication.

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!
Your application is now accessible to others with Microsoft credentials. The red-moss deployment is the primary working URL you can share immediately.

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps
1. Test authentication on both URLs
2. Share the red-moss URL with your team
3. Use localhost for development and testing
4. The application is ready for production use!

AZURE STATIC WEB APPS DEPLOYMENT FORCE - 2025-09-17 23:15 UTC+3

This file exists solely to force Azure Static Web Apps to detect changes and rebuild.

CRITICAL ISSUE:
- Local code in both directories is CLEAN (no "Updated" debugging text)
- Azure Static Web Apps is serving OLD CACHED VERSION from unknown source
- User still sees "UX Development Requests Dashboard (Updated)" on live site
- All our local files show "Content Development Requests Dashboard" (clean)

This is the SAME ISSUE from yesterday - Azure deployment pipeline is fundamentally broken.

Expected after this deployment:
- Clean "Content Development Requests Dashboard" title (no "Updated")
- Clean subtitle without "No Mock Data Version" text
- Proper functionality without debugging markers

If this doesn't work, Azure Static Web Apps needs direct intervention in Azure Portal.

Deployment timestamp: 2025-09-17 23:15:25 UTC+3

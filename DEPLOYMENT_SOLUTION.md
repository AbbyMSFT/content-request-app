# Deployment Solution - Working URL Found!

## Current Status
✅ **WORKING**: https://red-moss-0ff10900f-preview.eastus2.1.azurestaticapps.net/ (HTTP 200)
❌ **BROKEN**: https://brave-field-0e65e2c0f.4.azurestaticapps.net/ (HTTP 404)

## Root Cause
Your GitHub Actions workflow is deploying to the `brave-field` deployment, but you have a working `red-moss` deployment that's already functional.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use the Working Red-Moss Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
**Advantages**: Immediate solution, already working, no deployment issues

**Steps**:
1. Azure AD is already configured for this URL ✅
2. Test authentication on: https://red-moss-0ff10900f-preview.eastus2.1.azurestaticapps.net/
3. Share this working URL with others
4. Keep using this deployment

### Option 2: Fix Brave-Field Deployment
**Steps**:
1. Create new Azure Static Web Apps resource
2. Update GitHub Actions deployment token
3. Add brave-field URL to Azure AD redirect URIs
4. Deploy and test

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Test the Working Deployment
1. Go to: https://red-moss-0ff10900f-preview.eastus2.1.azurestaticapps.net/
2. Try authentication - should work since Azure AD already has this URL
3. If it works, you can immediately share this with others!

### Step 2: Fix Local Authentication
1. Add `http://localhost:5178` to Azure AD redirect URIs
2. Test localhost authentication at: http://localhost:5178/

### Step 3: Decide on Long-term Solution
- **Keep red-moss**: Use it as your primary deployment
- **Fix brave-field**: Create new Azure Static Web Apps resource

## Why Red-Moss is Working
- It was deployed earlier and is functional
- Azure AD already has the correct redirect URI configured
- The deployment token for red-moss is still valid

## Next Steps
1. Test red-moss deployment immediately
2. Fix Azure AD redirect URIs for localhost
3. Decide whether to stick with red-moss or fix brave-field

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use the working red-moss deployment and save time!

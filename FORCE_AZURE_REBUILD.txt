FORCE AZURE STATIC WEB APPS REBUILD - 2025-09-17-22:38

This file exists solely to force Azure Static Web Apps to detect changes and rebuild.
The live site is serving old cached code that contains "Updated" debugging markers.

Current issues on live site:
- Shows "UX Development Requests Dashboard (Updated)" instead of clean title
- Shows "No Mock Data Version" text
- Tries to connect to localhost:3003 (old code) instead of /api/ routes
- Serves "Fallback Demo Data" instead of real Azure DevOps data

Expected after this deployment:
- Clean "Content Development Requests Dashboard" title
- No debugging markers or "Updated" text
- Proper API routing to /api/workitems
- Real Azure DevOps integration working

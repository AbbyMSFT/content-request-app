# EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT FORCE

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-18 00:08:00
**Build ID:** EMERGENCY-CACHE-CLEAR-20250918
**Commit Hash:** c96c922c2c9fdf51ae702d61da52bfd7d76fd1f8
**Version:** 3.0.0

## Issue
Azure Static Web Apps deployment failing - previous deployment stuck serving old cached content with:
- "UX Development Request Manager" (old title)
- "No Mock Data Version" (debugging text)
- Hebrew text and images (completely wrong content)

## Solution
This file forces a new deployment with aggressive cache clearing:
1. Updated all cache-busting comments with new timestamps
2. Changed version to 3.0.0
3. Added build ID for tracking
4. Forcing complete rebuild

## Expected Result
After successful deployment, site should show:
- "Content Development Requests Dashboard" (correct title)
- "Manage and track all content development requests" (correct subtitle)
- No Hebrew text or unwanted images
- Latest authentication configuration using environment variables

## Verification
Check https://ashy-field-08756110f.1.azurestaticapps.net/dashboard after deployment completes.
